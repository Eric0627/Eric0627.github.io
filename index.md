## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of California San Diego, advised by Prof. [Vineet Bafna](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/node/3480){:target="_blank"}. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shuai Cheng Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~shuaicli/){:target="_blank"}.

## Research Interests

My research interests are in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly applied algorithms on cancer genomics and complex structural variants. I am broadly interested in designing computational tools and machine learning methods that can efficiently and effectively make core scientific insights into biology and medicine.
